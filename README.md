## Introduction

Apache Spark is an open-source big data processing framework that allows you to perform batch processing, real-time stream processing, machine learning, and graph processing on large-scale datasets. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and data scientists.

This repository aims to keep you up-to-date with the latest features and improvements in Spark by providing clear and concise examples. Each feature example will be well-documented and presented in a way that facilitates understanding and adoption.

## Installation

To run the examples in this repository, you need to have Apache Spark installed on your system. Please follow the instructions below to install Spark:

1. **Download Spark**: Visit the official Apache Spark website (https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and download the latest version of Spark.

2. **Extract the Archive**: Once the download is complete, extract the Spark archive to a directory of your choice.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Set up the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where Spark is extracted. Additionally, add Spark's `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

4. **Java**: Spark requires Java to be installed. Make sure you have Java 8 or higher installed on your system and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is properly set.

5. **Python**: If you plan to use Spark with Python, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Spark supports Python 3.6+.

6. **Scala**: If you plan to use Spark with Scala, you can use the Scala API provided by Spark out of the box.

Congratulations! You now have Spark installed on your system and are ready to run the examples.
